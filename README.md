# üöÄ beam_builder

**beam_builder** is a learning project focused on integrating **Elixir** with **GitHub Actions**.  
It explores modern CI/CD practices for applications running on the **BEAM VM**, aiming to automate build, test, and deployment workflows in a robust and efficient way.

## üéØ Goals

- Set up GitHub Actions for Elixir-based projects
- Automate tests and code analysis using GitHub workflows
- Use caching strategies for Mix and Hex dependencies
- Explore deployment simulations (e.g., OTP releases or Phoenix apps)
- Document best practices for CI/CD in the Elixir ecosystem
